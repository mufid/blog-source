Update: Thanks [IceHouse] for giving me opportunity to have great work! :D

I am Muhammad Mufid Afif. Currently i am third year student in Faculty of <F24>Computer Science.

I love to do hacks. See my [Github] for my latest hacks. I love hacks in PHP and Rails. I love user interface design, though i am not master in design.

I am looking for intern this summer as part of my graduation prerequisites. I will do my best intern with my best attidude and surely i will do great hacks. I am living in Indonesia, but i am able to go abroad if needed.

Please kindly contact me at mufid.afif[at]gmail[dot]com.

Thank you very much,

Mufid
