It is interesting fact that some part of this world tends to "roll your own server." However, i can understand that these days we should trust no one, even host provider. Thus, we should host our own data, our own email, and we must make sure nobody can see that so we encrypt those.

But in fact, that is not the summit of the reality. Hosting everything, by ourself, is expensive. Most "cloud" provider gives freemium plan. Think Dropbox, with their 2 GB free of "cloud" space. By trusting their provider, my previous paragraph is no more relevant. But the fact seems like contradicting each other.

"If you can roll your own server, why do you bother giving your data to unknown people?" "Because it is easier! Heck, it is even more secure!"

How do you know it is more secure? By reading its whitepaper? What if their implementation is different with the whitepaper? How do you know your entire machine is encrypted by XTS-AES?

We continously bomb ourselves with "unnecessary" yet "important" question. And endless drama between "trusting" and "effort".
